  "context": "Professional translation work",
  "introduction": {
    "overview": "This week explores the subtle distinctions between modal and semi-modal verbs that advanced learners often confuse. We'll examine how context, formality, and speaker intention shape modal and semi-modal verb selection in professional translation work. Semi-modals (like 'have to', 'need to', 'be able to', 'be supposed to', 'had better') function similarly to modals but follow different grammatical patterns.",
    "objectives": [
      "Distinguish between similar modals and semi-modals (must/have to/need to, should/ought to/had better, can/be able to)",
      "Identify register and formality shifts in modal and semi-modal usage",
      "Apply appropriate modals and semi-modals in translation contexts",
      "Recognize grammatical differences between modals and semi-modals"

      {
        "heading": "Obligation and Necessity: Modals vs. Semi-Modals",
        "content": "The distinction between <strong>must</strong>, <strong>have to</strong>, and <strong>need to</strong> often trips up even advanced speakers. <em>Must</em> expresses internal obligation or strong advice ('I must finish this translation today'), while <em>have to</em> indicates external obligation ('I have to submit this by Friday because the client requires it'). <em>Need to</em> expresses practical necessity without the urgency of 'must' or the external pressure of 'have to' ('I need to update my terminology database'). Remember: semi-modals like 'have to' and 'need to' conjugate for tense and person (has to, needed to), while pure modals like 'must' do not.",
        "example": "Compare: 'You must proofread carefully' (internal conviction) vs. 'You have to use the client's style guide' (external requirement) vs. 'You need to build your portfolio' (practical necessity)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Ability: Can vs. Be Able To",
        "content": "<strong>Can</strong> expresses general ability or informal permission, while <strong>be able to</strong> is used for specific achievements, especially in the past. For translation work, this distinction is crucial: 'I can translate legal documents' (general ability) versus 'I was able to finish the contract yesterday' (specific past achievement). <em>Be able to</em> is also necessary in perfect tenses and after other modals: 'I haven't been able to contact the client' or 'I might be able to help you tomorrow.'",
        "example": "'She can speak five languages' (general ability) vs. 'She was able to interpret the entire conference without breaks' (specific achievement)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Permission and Possibility",
        "content": "<strong>Can</strong> is informal permission or ability, while <strong>may</strong> is formal permission or possibility. In professional contexts, this distinction matters significantly. Note that 'can' is a pure modal, while alternatives for expressing permission in different tenses require semi-modal constructions.",
        "example": "'May I suggest an alternative translation?' (formal) vs. 'Can I help you with that file?' (informal collaborative setting)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Advice and Strong Recommendations",
        "content": "<strong>Should</strong> is direct advice, <strong>ought to</strong> carries moral weight or stronger expectation, and <strong>had better</strong> (a semi-modal) expresses urgent advice or warning, often with negative consequences implied. The latter is less common in American English but appears in formal British texts. <em>Had better</em> is particularly strong: 'You had better submit this on time' implies serious consequences if you don't.",
        "example": "'You should check the terminology' (practical advice) vs. 'Translators ought to respect source material' (professional principle) vs. 'You'd better meet this deadline or we'll lose the client' (urgent warning)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Expectations: Be Supposed To",
        "content": "<strong>Be supposed to</strong> is a semi-modal that expresses expectations, obligations based on rules or plans, or what is generally understood to happen. It's particularly useful in professional contexts: 'I'm supposed to attend the translation conference next month' (planned obligation) or 'The files are supposed to arrive by email' (expected to happen). Unlike 'should,' it emphasizes external expectations rather than personal opinion.",
        "example": "'You're supposed to use the company's CAT tool' (company expectation) vs. 'You should learn to use CAT tools' (general advice)"
