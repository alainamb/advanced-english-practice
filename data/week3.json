  "breadcrumb": "Week 3: Aspect vs. Tense",
  "introduction": {
    "overview": "This week distinguishes between two fundamental but often confused concepts: tense (when something happens) and aspect (how an action unfolds over time). While tense locates an event in time (past, present, future), aspect reveals the internal structure of that event—whether it's complete, ongoing, habitual, or repeated. Understanding this distinction is crucial for translation work, as languages structure temporal information differently.",
    "objectives": [
      "Distinguish clearly between tense (external time reference) and aspect (internal time structure)",
      "Identify and interpret perfective, imperfective, progressive, and habitual aspects in English",
      "Recognize how aspect choices shape meaning in travel narratives and personal storytelling",
      "Apply aspectual knowledge to translation decisions involving temporality and event structure"

    "sections": [
      {
        "heading": "Tense vs. Aspect: The Essential Distinction",
        "content": "<strong>Tense</strong> tells us WHEN something happens (past, present, future), while <strong>aspect</strong> tells us HOW an event unfolds internally—its completion status, duration, or repetition. This is not merely an academic distinction: many translation challenges arise when languages encode these concepts differently. English combines tense and aspect in verb phrases: 'I traveled' (past tense, perfective aspect) versus 'I was traveling' (past tense, progressive aspect). The time reference is the same (both past), but the aspectual perspective differs dramatically.",
        "example": "Compare: 'I visited Paris last summer' (completed event) vs. 'I was visiting Paris when I met Jean' (ongoing event providing background)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Perfective Aspect: Completed Events",
        "content": "<strong>Perfective aspect</strong> presents an event as a complete whole, with a clear beginning and endpoint. In travel narratives, perfective forms report specific completed actions: arrivals, departures, discoveries, and achievements. English uses the simple past for perfective meanings in past contexts. The perfective doesn't necessarily mean the action was quick—only that we're viewing it as a bounded, complete unit rather than focusing on its internal progression.",
        "example": "'We flew to Tokyo, checked into our hotel, and explored the neighborhood.' (Three completed events viewed as a sequence)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Imperfective Aspect: Ongoing and Habitual Events",
        "content": "<strong>Imperfective aspect</strong> presents events without emphasizing completion, focusing instead on their ongoing nature or habitual occurrence. The <strong>progressive</strong> (continuous) form shows ongoing action: 'We were hiking through the mountains when the storm began.' The <strong>habitual</strong> aspect describes repeated or characteristic actions: 'Every morning, we would walk to the local market.' Note that 'would' for past habits is distinct from the modal meaning of 'would'—context determines which interpretation applies.",
        "example": "'During that month in Barcelona, I was learning Spanish, practicing with locals, and discovering new neighborhoods every weekend.' (Ongoing and habitual actions providing duration)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Aspect in Translation Contexts",
        "content": "Translation between Spanish and English requires careful attention to aspect because the languages encode it differently. Spanish marks perfective/imperfective overtly in the past (preterite vs. imperfect), while English uses combinations of tense, aspect markers (-ing), and auxiliary verbs. A common challenge: Spanish imperfect ('estaba caminando') can translate as either simple past ('I walked') or past progressive ('I was walking') depending on whether the focus is the habit itself or the ongoing action. The translator must interpret the source text's aspectual perspective.",
        "example": "Spanish 'Viajábamos a la playa cada verano' → 'We traveled to the beach every summer' (habitual) or 'We used to travel to the beach every summer' (explicit habit marker)"
