  "breadcrumb": "Week 6: Subject-Verb Agreement",
  "introduction": {
    "overview": "Subject-verb agreement might seem straightforward, but news writing presents sophisticated challenges that can trip up even advanced English users. This week, we'll tackle complex agreement situations involving collective nouns, indefinite pronouns, inverted structures, and compound subjects—all common features in journalistic and formal writing. Mastering these patterns will sharpen your ability to produce and evaluate professional English texts.",
    "objectives": [
      "Apply agreement rules for collective nouns in both British and American English contexts",
      "Correctly use singular or plural verbs with indefinite pronouns and quantifiers",
      "Identify and correct agreement errors in inverted sentence structures common in news leads",
      "Navigate agreement challenges with compound subjects, including those joined by 'or' and 'nor'"
    ]
  },
  "lecture": {
    "sections": [
      {
        "heading": "Collective Nouns: Unity vs. Individuality",
        "content": "<strong>Collective nouns</strong> (team, government, committee, audience, public) refer to groups and present a classic agreement challenge. In <strong>American English</strong>, they typically take singular verbs when emphasizing the group as a unit, while <strong>British English</strong> often uses plural verbs when focusing on individual members. The key is consistency and context—news about unified action uses singular verbs, while news about internal disagreement or individual actions uses plural verbs.",
        "example": "<strong>American style:</strong> \"The committee has approved the budget proposal.\"<br><strong>British style:</strong> \"The government have failed to reach consensus on the issue.\"<br><strong>Context matters:</strong> \"The team is celebrating its victory\" (unified action) vs. \"The team are arguing among themselves\" (individual actions)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Indefinite Pronouns and Quantifiers",
        "content": "<strong>Indefinite pronouns</strong> like everyone, someone, anybody, nobody, and each always take singular verbs, even when they seem to refer to multiple people. <strong>Quantifiers</strong> follow different patterns: 'all,' 'some,' 'most,' and 'none' can be singular or plural depending on what they refer to. Words like 'a number of' take plural verbs, while 'the number of' takes singular verbs—a subtle distinction that affects news writing about statistics and data.",
        "example": "<strong>Always singular:</strong> \"Everyone in the affected regions is eligible for aid.\"<br><strong>Depends on context:</strong> \"Some of the evidence was destroyed\" (evidence = uncountable) vs. \"Some of the documents were destroyed\" (documents = countable)<br><strong>Number expressions:</strong> \"A number of protestors have gathered\" vs. \"The number of protestors has increased\""
      },
      {
        "heading": "Inverted Structures in News Writing",
        "content": "News leads often use <strong>inverted word order</strong>, placing the verb before the subject for emphasis or stylistic effect. This inversion can obscure the true subject, leading to agreement errors. Sentences beginning with <strong>'there' or 'here'</strong> are common culprits, as are sentences starting with prepositional phrases or adverbials. The key is identifying the actual subject—look past opening phrases to find the noun that performs the action.",
        "example": "<strong>There/Here inversions:</strong> \"There remains several unanswered questions\" (incorrect) → \"There remain several unanswered questions\" (correct—'questions' is the subject)<br><strong>Prepositional phrase openings:</strong> \"Among the topics discussed were climate policy\" (correct—'topics' is the subject)<br><strong>News lead style:</strong> \"Following the announcement comes new regulations\" (incorrect) → \"Following the announcement come new regulations\" (correct)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Compound Subjects: And, Or, Nor",
        "content": "<strong>Compound subjects</strong> joined by 'and' typically require plural verbs, but there are exceptions when the compound forms a single concept. Subjects joined by <strong>'or' or 'nor'</strong> follow the proximity rule: the verb agrees with the subject closest to it. This construction is common in news writing when presenting alternatives or describing multiple actors. Special attention is needed when one subject is singular and one plural.",
        "example": "<strong>And (usually plural):</strong> \"The president and vice president have issued a joint statement.\"<br><strong>And (single concept):</strong> \"Law and order remains the campaign's central theme.\"<br><strong>Or/Nor (proximity rule):</strong> \"Neither the senator nor her aides were available for comment.\" \"Neither the aides nor the senator was available for comment.\""

        "answer": "show",
        "hint": "Think about whether 'data' is being used as singular or plural here.",
        "explanation": "'Data' is the plural of 'datum' and takes a plural verb in most modern usage, especially in news and scientific contexts. 'The data show' is correct."

        "prompt": "Identify the subject and choose the correct verb: Behind the statistics (lie/lies) the stories of real families.",
        "answer": "lie",
        "hint": "Don't be distracted by the prepositional phrase at the beginning.",
        "explanation": "The subject is 'stories' (plural), not 'statistics.' The inverted structure places the prepositional phrase first, but the verb must agree with 'stories': 'lie' is correct."
      },
      {
        "prompt": "Fix this sentence: Neither the witnesses nor the suspect were willing to testify.",
        "answer": "was",
        "hint": "Remember the proximity rule for 'neither...nor.'",
        "explanation": "With 'neither...nor,' the verb agrees with the nearest subject. 'Suspect' (singular) is closest to the verb, so it should be 'was willing to testify.'"
      },
      {
        "prompt": "Choose the correct verb form: Each of the candidates (has/have) proposed different solutions to the crisis.",
        "answer": "has",
        "hint": "'Each' is always singular, even when followed by 'of the [plural noun].'",
        "explanation": "'Each' is a singular indefinite pronoun and always takes a singular verb, regardless of the plural noun in the prepositional phrase. 'Each...has proposed' is correct."

        ],
        "correct": "Both are correct depending on whether you're using British or American English.",
        "explanation": "This is a genuine British/American difference.
