  "context": "Academic Writing/Research",
  "introduction": {
    "overview": "This week explores sophisticated punctuation marks that often distinguish professional academic writing from everyday prose. We'll examine how colons, semicolons, dashes, and parentheses function as precision tools in research papers, scholarly articles, and formal translations. Understanding these marks is essential for translating academic texts accurately and for crafting your own research writing.",
    "objectives": [
      "Deploy colons strategically to introduce explanations, lists, and quotations in academic contexts",
      "Use semicolons to connect related independent clauses and manage complex series with internal punctuation",
      "Distinguish between em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens, applying each appropriately in scholarly writing",
      "Apply parentheses and brackets correctly for citations, clarifications, and supplementary information"
    ]

    "sections": [
      {
        "heading": "The Colon: Introducing and Explaining",
        "content": "The <strong>colon</strong> acts as a spotlight, directing readers' attention to what follows. In academic writing, colons introduce <strong>explanations</strong>, <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, and <strong>formal quotations</strong>. The key principle: what precedes the colon must be a complete independent clause that could stand alone as a sentence. Colons signal 'here's what I mean' or 'here's the evidence.' They're particularly valuable in research writing for introducing methodology, findings, or supporting details.",
        "example": "The study revealed three significant factors: participant motivation, time constraints, and resource availability. (Note: 'The study revealed three significant factors' is a complete clause)"
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Semicolon: Connecting and Organizing",
        "content": "The <strong>semicolon</strong> has two primary academic functions. First, it connects closely related <strong>independent clauses</strong> without a coordinating conjunction, showing that ideas are equally weighted and intimately connected. Second, it separates items in a <strong>complex series</strong> where individual elements already contain commas. This second function is especially important in academic writing with lengthy citations or multi-part findings. Think of semicolons as creating balance and managing complexity.",
        "example": "Translation theory has evolved considerably; current approaches emphasize cultural mediation over literal equivalence. / The survey included participants from Madrid, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico; and Buenos Aires, Argentina."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Dashes: Emphasis and Interruption",
        "content": "Academic writers use three dash types: the <strong>em dash</strong> (—) for emphatic interruptions or clarifications, the <strong>en dash</strong> (–) for ranges and connections between equal elements, and the <strong>hyphen</strong> (-) for compound modifiers. The <strong>em dash</strong> is more dramatic than parentheses but less formal than a colon—it adds emphasis and flexibility. The <strong>en dash</strong> appears in page ranges (pp. 45–67), date spans (2015–2020), and between equal terms (the participant–researcher relationship). Em dashes typically appear without spaces in American style.",
        "example": "The methodology—which was adapted from Chen (2019)—yielded unexpected results. / The pre-test–post-test design measured improvement over a 12–15 week period."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Parentheses and Brackets: Supplementing and Clarifying",
        "content": "<strong>Parentheses</strong> enclose supplementary information, citations, acronym definitions, and optional details that support but don't interrupt the main argument. <strong>Brackets</strong> indicate editorial insertions within quotations or provide clarifications within parenthetical material. In academic writing, proper use of parentheses is essential for <strong>in-text citations</strong> (APA, MLA, Chicago styles), while brackets show you've modified a quotation for clarity or grammar. Brackets signal 'this change is mine, not the original author's.'",
        "example": "Translation memory tools (TMT) can increase productivity by 30–40% (Garcia, 2021). / According to the study, \"[T]he impact on professional translators was significant\" (Lopez, 2022, p. 154)."
