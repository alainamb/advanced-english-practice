  "breadcrumb": "Week 12: Phrasal Verbs",
  "context": "Entertainment & Pop Culture",
  "introduction": {
    "overview": "This week explores phrasal verbs—those dynamic verb + particle combinations that are essential to natural, conversational English. We'll examine how these multi-word verbs function in entertainment contexts, from movie reviews to music criticism, learning to distinguish between separable and inseparable forms and between literal and figurative meanings. Understanding phrasal verbs is crucial for translation work, as they rarely translate word-for-word and often carry cultural nuances that require careful interpretation.",
    "objectives": [
      "Identify and correctly use separable and inseparable phrasal verbs in context",
      "Distinguish between literal (transparent) and figurative (opaque) meanings of phrasal verbs",
      "Apply appropriate phrasal verbs when discussing entertainment media (film, music, television)",
      "Recognize register differences: when phrasal verbs are appropriate versus when formal single-word verbs are preferred"

      {
        "heading": "Separable vs. Inseparable Phrasal Verbs",
        "content": "<strong>Separable phrasal verbs</strong> allow (and sometimes require) a noun or pronoun object to come between the verb and particle. Common examples include <em>turn down</em> (reject), <em>put off</em> (postpone), and <em>bring up</em> (mention). When the object is a pronoun, separation is mandatory: 'She turned it down' (not 'turned down it'). <strong>Inseparable phrasal verbs</strong> keep the verb and particle together: <em>look into</em> (investigate), <em>come across</em> (find unexpectedly), <em>run into</em> (encounter). The object must follow the complete phrasal verb: 'I ran into my favorite actor' (not 'ran my favorite actor into').",
        "example": "Separable: 'The studio turned down the screenplay' or 'The studio turned the screenplay down' or 'The studio turned it down.' Inseparable: 'I came across an amazing indie film' (not 'came an amazing indie film across')"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Literal vs. Figurative Meanings",
        "content": "<strong>Literal phrasal verbs</strong> have transparent meanings where both the verb and particle retain their basic senses: <em>sit down</em>, <em>walk in</em>, <em>turn around</em>. These are relatively easy to understand and translate. <strong>Figurative phrasal verbs</strong> have meanings that aren't predictable from their parts: <em>break up</em> (end a relationship, not physically break), <em>catch on</em> (become popular or understand, not physically catch), <em>blow up</em> (become very successful or angry). Some phrasal verbs have both literal and figurative meanings depending on context, which makes them particularly challenging for translation.",
        "example": "Literal: 'Turn up the volume on the speakers.' Figurative: 'That new band is really starting to catch on with audiences'—meaning gain popularity, not literally catching anything"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Common Phrasal Verbs in Entertainment Reviews",
        "content": "Entertainment writing relies heavily on specific phrasal verbs that convey nuanced judgments: <strong>live up to</strong> (meet expectations), <strong>fall flat</strong> (fail to impress), <strong>stand out</strong> (be noticeably excellent), <strong>drag on</strong> (be too long and boring), <strong>pick up</strong> (improve or gain speed). These phrasal verbs allow critics to express complex evaluations concisely and idiomatically. Understanding these common patterns helps translators capture the intended tone and judgment rather than translating literally, which would sound unnatural.",
        "example": "'The sequel didn't live up to the original, and the middle act really dragged on, though the special effects stood out as exceptional'"
      },
      {
        "heading": "Register and Formality Considerations",
        "content": "Phrasal verbs are generally more <strong>informal and conversational</strong> than their single-word equivalents. In formal writing, you might prefer <em>postpone</em> over <em>put off</em>, <em>investigate</em> over <em>look into</em>, or <em>tolerate</em> over <em>put up with</em>. However, in entertainment journalism, social media, and casual reviews, phrasal verbs create a more accessible, engaging tone. For translation work, recognizing register helps you choose whether to preserve the informality or elevate the language depending on the target audience and purpose.",
        "example": "Informal review: 'The show really picks up in season two.' Formal analysis: 'The series improves substantially in its second season.' Both convey similar meaning but different registers"

    "message": "Congratulations on completing this exploration of phrasal verbs! You've developed crucial skills for understanding one of English's most distinctive and challenging features. Your ability to recognize separability, distinguish literal from figurative meanings, and choose appropriate register will serve you well in both translation work and natural English communication.",
    "takeaways": [
      "Separable phrasal verbs allow objects between verb and particle; with pronouns, separation is mandatory",
      "Inseparable phrasal verbs keep verb and particle together, with objects following the complete unit",
      "Literal phrasal verbs are transparent; figurative ones have non-compositional meanings",
      "Entertainment writing heavily uses phrasal verbs like 'catch on,' 'fall flat,' 'live up to,' and 'stand out'",
      "Phrasal verbs are generally informal; formal contexts often prefer single-word equivalents",
      "Context determines whether a phrasal verb is used literally or figuratively",
      "Effective translation requires finding functional equivalents, not word-for-word translations"
